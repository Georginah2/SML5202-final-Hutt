<h1> <strong> Pretty in-troduction (to the French language) </strong> </h1>
<body> <h2> Background to French </h2>
 <p> French, fran√ßais, is a Romance language spoken as a first language by around 136 million people worldwide. A total of 500 million speak it as either a first, second, or foreign language. French is a descendant of the Latin language of the Roman Empire, as are national languages such as Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, Romanian and Catalan. As a result of extensive colonial ambitions of France and Belgium, between the 17th and 20th centuries, French was introduced to America, Africa, Polynesia, South-East Asia, and the Caribbean. <p>

However, they prefer it when you make the effort, and might even speak back to you in English if you start the conversation in French. </th>
